- Every system has its boot process—mine started with a quest to revive an old PC. This humble start led me to the world of system optimizations, exploring Linux distributions, and experimenting with hardware-software interplay.

- Today, I’m driven by a fascination for how systems work at their core, seeking to improve and innovate wherever possible.

Here’s what powers my experiments:

- Core Modules:
Artix Linux for its efficiency and simplicity.
Bash scripting to automate workflows.
Rust for creating lean, performant tools.
- IO Interfaces:
Kitty terminal: Sleek and fast.
Rofi: Custom menus for seamless interaction.
- Performance Enhancements:
RAID 0 setups to push storage boundaries.
Exploring microcontrollers to bridge software and hardware.
Current Exploration: Processor designs and how architectures shape modern systems.

- Preferred Workflow: Minimalist setups with maximum efficiency.

- When Idle: Reading open-source forums, curating my music library, and optimizing processes.

- Philosophy: "Optimization isn’t just about performance—it’s about clarity and purpose."
