Every system has its boot process—mine started with a quest to revive an old PC. This humble start led me to the world of system optimizations, exploring Linux distributions, and experimenting with hardware-software interplay.

Today, I’m driven by a fascination for how systems work at their core, seeking to improve and innovate wherever possible.

Here’s what powers my experiments:

- Core Modules:
Artix Linux for its efficiency and simplicity.
Bash scripting to automate workflows.
Rust for creating lean, performant tools.
- IO Interfaces:
Kitty terminal: Sleek and fast.
Rofi: Custom menus for seamless interaction.
- Performance Enhancements:
RAID 0 setups to push storage boundaries.
Exploring microcontrollers to bridge software and hardware.
Current Exploration: Processor designs and how architectures shape modern systems.

- Running Processes:

           - Artix OS Tweaks: Streamlining my environment for optimal            performance.
          - Storage Innovation: Experimenting with RAID configurations to enhance speed and redundancy.
          - Microcontroller Programming: Bridging the gap between hardware and software.
          - Queued Tasks:
          Diving deeper into embedded systems design.
          Exploring the intricacies of processor efficiency and architecture.
           Crafting tools to simplify complex workflows.

Systems—whether hardware or software—fascinate me because of how they interact, communicate, and optimize. My projects have taught me to appreciate the elegance of design, whether it’s in streamlining code or understanding the logic of circuit design.

I thrive at the intersection of innovation, problem-solving, and precision, constantly seeking ways to bridge ideas with execution.

Preferred Workflow: Minimalist setups with maximum efficiency.
When Idle: Reading open-source forums, curating my music library, and optimizing processes.
Philosophy: "Optimization isn’t just about performance—it’s about clarity and purpose."

I joined GitHub more recently, but this is not the first time I’ve shared my work. Earlier, I had a profile where I uploaded my projects, but I’ve since moved away from Google-based services (de-Google-ing) and had to remove that account. This new profile reflects my continued journey, and the projects here were previously stored in my old repositories. That’s why most of these were uploaded recently—just a fresh start with the same projects and more to come
